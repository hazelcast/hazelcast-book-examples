## ABOUT
This project is prepared to serve as the most basic sample application for the WAN replication implementation built in
Hazelcast Enterprise. The project creates two clusters in Active-Passive WAN replication mode where the members can be
configured with either XML, YAML or programmatic configuration. All source- and target-side configurations are identical, 
so a source cluster member configured with XML configuration can connect to a target configured with programmatic or YAML
configuration.
 
## The Scenario
There are two clusters replicating in Active-Passive mode. The active side is the source cluster where the write operations are
done, in this simple case these are map puts. The passive side is the target cluster that receives the updates from the source
cluster and applies them. The two clusters are formed by the members started with `WanSource` and `WanTarget` main classes
respectively. Both clusters print the size of the map named `wan-replicated-map` in every second, but only the source cluster
calls `map.put()`, it puts 10 new entries in every second. If the `WanTarget` main class is started first, it prints 0 every
second. After starting the `WanSource` cluster, eventually the source and the target cluster members start printing the same size
for the map meaning the entries are replicated from the source cluster to the target cluster.   
 
## Running the Sample Applications
First, a configuration way should be chosen both for the source and the target clusters. By default, both clusters use
programmatic configuration. Switching between the configuration methods can be done by keeping the line performs the chosen
configuration method uncommented in `WanSource` and `WanTarget` classes as shown below:
```java
//        HazelcastInstance hz = instanceConfiguredWithXml();
//        HazelcastInstance hz = instanceConfiguredWithYaml();
HazelcastInstance hz = instanceConfiguredProgrammatically();
```   

Then, your Hazelcast Enterprise license key needs to be set in the configuration. This can be done in the following places.
###### WAN Source Cluster

- XML: hazelcast-wan-source.xml
- YAML: hazelcast-wan-source.yaml
- Programmatic: com.hazelcast.wan.WanSource.LICENSE_KEY constant

###### WAN Target Cluster

- XML: hazelcast-wan-target.xml
- YAML: hazelcast-wan-target.yaml
- Programmatic: com.hazelcast.wan.WanTarget.LICENSE_KEY constant

After the license key is set, the source and target cluster members can be started with the following maven commands:
- target cluster: `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.hazelcast.wan.WanTarget`  
- source cluster: `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.hazelcast.wan.WanSource`

The order of starting the cluster members doesn't matter, the source cluster retains the WAN events in its WAN queue up to 10000
events by default.
