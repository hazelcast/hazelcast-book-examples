# Hazelcast Embedded with Eureka discovery

This is a sample Spring Boot application with embedded Hazelcast, which presents forming a Hazelcast cluster using the [Hazelcast Eureka plugin](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-eureka).

## Introduction

This Code Sample contains 4 projects:
 * `eureka-server` - Eureka Server (not related to Hazelcast)
 * `hazelcast-only` - Spring Boot Application which registers Hazelcast member in Eureka
 * `hazelcast-separate-client` - Spring Boot Application which registers both Hazelcast member and the Spring Boot application itself in Eureka (Hazelcast member uses a separate Eureka Client than the application)
 * `hazelcast-metadata` - Spring Boot Application which registers both Hazelcast member and the Spring Boot application itself in Eureka (Hazelcast member uses the same Eureka Client than the application)
 
 To start any interaction, you need to build all the projects with the following command.
 
    $ mvn clean package

## 1. Start Eureka server

To use Eureka discovery, you need first to start the Eureka server. Usually you would start multiple instances to provide high availability, but in this Code Sample a single localhost instance is good enough.

    $ java -jar eureka-server/target/eureka-server-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

You can see that Eureka Sever started correctly by opening the browser at: http://localhost:8761.

## 2.1 Hazelcast Only

The first project `hazelcast-only` presents how to use the Eureka-based Hazelcast discovery, if you don't need to register your Spring Boot application at the same time.

The simplest Hazelcast configuration looks as follows.

```java
@Bean
public Config hazelcastConfig() {
    Config config = new Config();
    config.getProperties().setProperty("hazelcast.discovery.enabled", "true");
    JoinConfig joinConfig = config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin();
    joinConfig.getMulticastConfig().setEnabled(false);
    
    EurekaOneDiscoveryStrategyFactory discoveryStrategyFactory = new EurekaOneDiscoveryStrategyFactory();
    Map<String, Comparable> properties = new HashMap<String, Comparable>();
    properties.put("self-registration", "true");
    properties.put("namespace", "hazelcast");
    DiscoveryStrategyConfig discoveryStrategyConfig = new DiscoveryStrategyConfig(discoveryStrategyFactory, properties);
    joinConfig.getDiscoveryConfig().addDiscoveryStrategyConfig(discoveryStrategyConfig);

    return config;
}
```

You also need to configure the Eureka Client specific properties in the `eureka-client.properties` file.

```properties
hazelcast.shouldUseDns=false
hazelcast.name=hazelcast-only
hazelcast.serviceUrl.default=http://localhost:8761/eureka/
```

Then, you can start the first application.

    $ java -jar hazelcast-only/target/hazelcast-only-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8081 --hazelcast.port=5703

Then, start the second application.

    $ java -jar hazelcast-only/target/hazelcast-only-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8080 --hazelcast.port=5701

You should see in the logs that Hazelcast members formed a cluster together.

```
...
Members {size:2, ver:2} [
        Member [172.16.8.53]:5703 - 48d1ff51-f7d4-477d-aba6-05fea7ccce4c
        Member [172.16.8.53]:5701 - 800fad2b-3aaf-4f28-b944-e75572664e40 this
]
...
```

In the Eureka web console, you should see the following "HAZELCAST-ONLY" entries.

That is the simplest Eureka-based Hazelcast discovery. Sometimes, however, you need to have both your application and Hazelcast registered in Eureka.

## 2.2 Hazelcast with separate Eureka Client

If you need to have your application registered in Eureka as well, then the simplest way is to use separate Eureka clients. Then, Hazelcast is registered completely separately and it's visible in Eureka as a separate application.

To achieve this effect, your Hazelcast configuration is exactly the same as in the previous point, but you need to add the Eureka Client configuration for your Spring Boot Application. You can do it by adding `@EnableDiscoveryClient` to your `Application` class and defining the following `bootstrap.properties` file.

```properties
spring.application.name=spring-boot-application
``` 

In this case, Hazelcast will be registered under the name "HAZELCAST-SEPARATE-CLIENT" and the application will be registered under the name "SPRING-BOOT-APPLICATION".

Start the first application.

    $ java -jar hazelcast-separate-client/target/hazelcast-separate-client-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8081 --hazelcast.port=5703

Then, start the second application.

    $ java -jar hazelcast-separate-client/target/hazelcast-separate-client-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8080 --hazelcast.port=5701
        
Hazelcast members should form a cluster together as in the previous section. You should also see two separate entries in the Eureka web console.

## 3. Verify that Application works correctly

You can check that the application works correctly by inserting a value into one of the instance and reading it in the other instance.
