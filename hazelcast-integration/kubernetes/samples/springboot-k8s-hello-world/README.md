# Hazelcast On Kubernetes Made Fairly Easy 

An step-by-step example to running Hazelcast on Kubernetes, the classic "_Hello World_"
style beginners introduction. 

The sample includes instructions and screenshots for running on Mac and Windows.

See [here](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/hazelcast-integration/kubernetes/samples/springboot-k8s-hello-world) for the code.

You don't need to be an expert on Hazelcast or Kubernetes to make this work, as we'll
explain the terminology and details as we go.

The code sample runs everything, including Kubernetes, on your computer. You don't
need access to a cloud provider of infrastructure. However, because it all runs on
your computer, your computer will need to have a reasonable degree of power for it
to work, as detailed in the next section, [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites).

## Prerequisites

Kubernetes oversees a number of virtual machines. In this sample these virtual
machines all run on your machine. So your machine needs enough power to support
multiple virtual machines.

On a Mac, this sample has been validated on a 4 core machine with 16GB of RAM.

XXX Windows XXX

If you've less power than this, it might work or everything might grind to a
halt as your machine starts swapping.
